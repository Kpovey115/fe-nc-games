# FE-NC-GAMES

## Why Has This Project Been Made

In this repo is a front end project that uses my last back end project of an API to make an interact web page. This project is power by REACT.

This is my first ever project that focuses on the front end of programming, it is for me a major milestone

## Project Summary

This project takes an already made api, being hosted on Heroku and builds a user interface for that data.

## Website Functionality

On this website users can navigate from reviews of board games. These reviews can be look at, all at once or filtered via category.
These two options can then be sorted by

```
Date
Number of votes
Number of Comments

All of the above can be changed between ascending and descending order
```

Users can also post and delete comments, vote on comments and reviews.
